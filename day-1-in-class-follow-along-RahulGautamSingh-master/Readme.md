# HTML and CSS Introduction


> Back in the days of the original printing press, printers created documents by arranging metal characters, dipping them in ink, and pressing them onto a piece of paper.
> In a lot of ways, that’s exactly what web developers do, except instead of arranging moveable type, they write HTML and CSS. We’re concerned with the same task as they were: conveying content in meaningful ways. We even deal with the same presentational issues they did, like selecting the font to use, setting the size of headings, and determining the space between lines of text.

> Printers used to print a bunch of pages and bind them into a book. Nowadays, we create a bunch of HTML files and link them together into a website. Learning HTML and CSS is a matter of understanding the available HTML markup and CSS rules to make a browser render those files exactly how they’re supposed to.

### Step 1
